## ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT (15% Portfolio Gap)

### üêõ **Critical Issues to Fix**

1. **ReqRes API Authentication** (High Priority)
   - Status: ReqRes now requires API key authentication
   - Impact: Tests failing with 401 errors
   - Solution: Update tests with proper authentication or replace with alternative API

2. **K6 HTML Report Generation** (Medium Priority)
   - Status: Minor JavaScript error in HTML report generation
   - Impact: Performance reports not generating properly
   - Solution: Fix null reference in `generateHTMLReport` function

3. **Performance Test Thresholds** (Medium Priority)
   - Status: Some thresholds failing (95th percentile > 500ms)
   - Impact: Tests marked as failed even with good performance
   - Solution: Adjust realistic thresholds based on API capabilities

### üîß **Enhancement Opportunities**

1. **Add CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Badge integration for test status

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Add architecture diagrams
   - Include screenshots of reports
   - Create demo video or GIF

3. **Add More APIs**
   - Replace ReqRes with a stable alternative
   - Add GraphQL API testing example

## üéØ **PORTFOLIO IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Current Portfolio Value: A-**
